# 👋 Hi, I'm MENGSHI

I don't write code — I build systems.

🔹 Narrative Architect | Protocol Coordination Strategist  
🔹 Exploring how narratives shape capital, power, and resource allocation in Web3  
🔹 Bridging protocol builders with expressive, pitch-ready structures  

---

## 🧠 What I’m building

- **Structure Map v1.0** – A map to decode protocol narratives, mechanism leverage points, and VC exit designs  
- **Expression System Toolkit** – Notion-based interfaces for collaborative storytelling, pitch decks & mechanism diagrams  
- **ETHGlobal-ready interface** – Coordination layer tools and collaboration templates for hackathon teams

## 🪄 Collaboration Intent

If you're building something with…

- Narrative power but lack structure  
- Mechanism complexity but no clear pitch  
- Protocol potential but poor onboarding  
- …let’s talk.
